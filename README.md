# Virtue
Updated 10/29/2019

This project was completed 2 years ago on that years most current version of Swift. I have not updated the project since then, and now it is full of conversion errors and other system errors. The project does not run due to the afformentioned conversion errors. However, all the code is still there.

The bulk of the code is under the main Virtue folder. Each folder within that is just used to seperate the different view controllers.
