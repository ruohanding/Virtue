# Virtue
Updated 10/29/2019

This project was completed 2 years ago on that years most current version of Swift. I have not updated the project since then, and now it is full of conversion errors and other system errors. The project does not compile due to the afformentioned conversion errors. However, all the code is still there.

The bulk of the code is under 'Virtue/Virtue'. Each folder within that is just used to seperate the different view controllers. For example 'Virtue/Virtue/Home View' includes every view controller on the home view.

The code is commented.

Google's 'Firebase' online databased was used for this project so there is reference to that throughout the project. The 'Pods' Folder is a part of the sertup for Firebase.
